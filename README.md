# bookshop-website – Web Development Project

This project was created as part of my Web Development course at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU).

## Overview

A simple responsive bookshop website with:

- Book listings and descriptions  
- Payment form with JavaScript validation  
- Works on both desktop and mobile screens

## Technologies

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript

## Project Structure

- `Product/` – Website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)  
- `Report/` – Usability and accessibility checklist

## Future Plans

This project started as a course assignment. In the future, I plan to:

- Add a backend using **Node.js** and **PostgreSQL** to turn it into a full-stack application  
- Or possibly create a new full-stack project from scratch using **React** instead of plain HTML and CSS  

During this unit, I was also completing a full-stack development course on Udemy, which complemented what I was learning at university. Thanks to both, I’ve built a solid foundation and plan to continue developing more advanced web applications going forward.
